# Deepfake-Detection
This project presents a Python-based deepfake detection system that compares real and manipulated facial images using image similarity metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The system is evaluated on a Kaggle deepfake image dataset downloaded programmatically using KaggleHub.
